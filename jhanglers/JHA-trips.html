                <h2>Full Day Fishing Trips</h2>
                <p>Experience the finest that Jackson Hole has to offer. Our full day trips are totally private trips, just you and your guide. The trip includes guide, gear, boat, instruction, lunch, drinks, etc.</p>

<p>All of the waters we fish offer unparalleled scenery, clean water, plentiful trout, and beautiful solitude.</p>

<p>Each boat holds 2 fishermen plus a guide. We can take 3 people per guide in the case of small children. Please call us directly to arrange for 3 people with a guide. Multiple boats are available and we can handle groups of any size.</p>

<p>We guide on a wide array of amazing waters here in Western Wyoming including the Snake River, Green River, Salt River, Firehole River, Lewis Lake, and more. We typically do not pre-arrange which river we will fish with you. That decision is made the day of the trip based on conditions. If you have a specific request, please note that in the comments section.</p>

<p>We will pick you up at your hotel (unless you are staying in some far off place), make a quick stop at a fly shop to get you a fishing license and some flies, then head to the river. Once at the river we will launch the boat, float downstream a bit, then pull over and start you off with a complete casting lesson (if needed). After that we will spend the morning floating the river, casting to fish, and progressively building your skills. Mid-day we will pull over and prepare a delicious stream side lunch for you. The afternoon will then be spent casting to more trout, working riffles, drop-offs, and side channels and enjoying the day on the water. At the end of your day we will return you to your hotel in time for dinner. As it is a private trip, we can customize your trip to you. If you have any special requests just let us know.</p>

        <p>Start your day with a sunrise wildlife tour, then spend your afternoon casting to rising trout on the beautiful Snake River.</p>

<p>Sunrise wildlife tours offer a four-hour introduction to the wildlife of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, taking advantage of the times of day when the animals are the most active. Expedition leaders know the best wildlife viewing spots, understand animal behavior, and will teach you how to find and observe wildlife on your own - without disturbing the animals or endangering yourself. Participants typically see a variety of species of birds and animals, including Jackson Hole's large-hoofed mammals. Customized, safari-style vehicles are equipped with sliding roof hatches and windows to maximize observation opportunities.</p>

<p>Next it’s off to the river, where you will spend the afternoon floating and fishing from your own private drift boat.

        <p>The ultimate Jackson Hole Experience! A stunning horseback ride into our mountain camp where you will enjoy gourmet meals, cozy campfires, trail rides, comfortable accommodations, western hospitality, and 16 miles of pristine creek water.</p>

<p>You will be well taken care of by horse pack guides who will give you all the instruction you need, fit your saddle and make your rides comfortable and enjoyable.

The creek is home to native cutthroat trout that rise readily to dry flies.</p>

<p>A typical trip looks like this: Start your first day with a two and a half hour trail ride into camp. After having lunch, you can choose to spend your afternoon fishing the creek, going for a trail ride, or just relaxing and exploring the camp area. Dinner of sizzling steak, grilled chicken or salmon, salad and all the fixin's are prepared over the open fire. Spend the evening lying under the stars and relaxing by the fire. When it's time to hit the sack, you will enjoy spacious wall tents with cots, sleeping bags, and fresh linens. (2 people per tent). You will awaken the next morning to breakfast such as flapjacks and sausage served along with cowboy coffee and juice. From there you can head out on the days adventure. Fishing, riding, hiking, wildlife viewing, or reading a book in the sun are just some of the things you can do in the solitude of our high mountain camp. After lunch we will mount up on the horses and head back to the trailhead. Two full days of enjoying Wyoming the way many dream of, but few actually do!</p>
